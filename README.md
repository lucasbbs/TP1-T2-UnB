# Software System for Free Guided Walking Tours - Continued

## Introduction

- This repository is the continuation of this other [project](https://github.com/lucasbbs/Assignment-T1-TP1) developed as part of a course on programming techniques in 2022.
- Building upon the previous project, we have effectively developed the software system, implementing a C++ CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for the entities using SQLite as the database management system.
- Additionally, we have provided additional tests and integrated a smoke test to ensure the robustness and correctness of the system.

## Activities to Be Performed

The following activities were performed as part of this project:

1. Construct the software architecture model composed of modules, interfaces between modules, and relationships.
2. Build a smoke test.
3. Declare interfaces between the presentation layer and service layer.
4. Code the presentation layer.
5. Code the service layer.
6. Create a video demonstrating the successful execution of the smoke test on the integrated code.

## Requirements to Be Fulfilled

1. The system was developed following the specified requirements, both functional and non-functional.
2. Documents were filled out clearly, with attention to spelling.
3. A coding convention was adopted (please specify the coding convention used in your work).
4. Both source code and executable code were provided.
5. Each class was identified by comments with the registration number of the student responsible for its implementation.
6. The software architecture model contained diagrams and textual descriptions of the responsibilities of each module, provided in a PDF file.
7. Interfaces between the presentation layer and service layer were declared using abstract classes.
8. Abstract classes were composed of pure virtual methods.
9. The presentation layer could be coded using PDCurses or via cin and cout.
10. The presentation layer depended on the services declared in the interfaces.
11. The service layer implemented the services declared in the interfaces.
12. The service layer could store objects in an in-memory data structure (queue, stack, etc.).
13. The service layer could store objects in a relational database using SQLite.
14. Associations between entities were implemented.
15. A smoke test was provided in a PDF file.
16. The smoke test comprised test cases, with one test case for each functionality provided by the system.
17. Each test case covered a scenario of success and included the name, steps, input data, and expected output data.
18. A Code::Blocks project was provided to compile and execute code without errors on the correction platform.
